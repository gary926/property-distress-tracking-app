# HANDOFF — Distress Radar

Read this first when picking the project up. It records the decisions made with
Garvit and how the moving parts fit.

## Decisions (agreed 2026-08-29)

- **Stack** follows the `/build-webapp` skill exactly: Cloudflare Pages +
  bundled worker, D1, React/Vite, hand-rolled router/charts/icons, one CSS
  file, runtime deps = react + react-dom only. Inter is **self-hosted**
  (`public/fonts/`), no Google Fonts at runtime.
- **v1 data**: live scraping via **Firecrawl** feeding `/api/ingest`; the
  bundled demo snapshot serves until the first ingest lands. No paid data
  feeds. Price history accrues in `price_points` across daily ingests — the
  price-drop/relist signals get sharper the longer the sweep runs.
- **Alerts, no paid tools**: a **daily scheduled Claude routine** (included in
  the Claude subscription) does the sweep and delivery — scrape → ingest →
  read `/api/digest` → email via Garvit's **Gmail connector** + push via the
  Claude app notification. Make/Zapier remain drop-in alternatives for the
  email leg (Garvit already runs Make sender scenarios). Web Push (VAPID) was
  deliberately skipped in v1.
- Scheduled work cannot run inside a Pages worker (no cron on Pages), which is
  why the sweep lives outside the app.

## Layout

- `src/shared/` — types, scoring engine, filters, formatters, demo snapshot.
  Shared by worker, frontend, and the fixtures server. Framework-free.
- `src/worker/` — route table (`index.ts`), auth (`auth.ts`: password login,
  HMAC cookie, sessions + rate limit in D1), data (`data.ts`: listings/ingest/
  state/digest). Every response is `{ok, data|error}` via `http.ts` — an
  architecture test enforces this.
- `src/app/` — React app. `router.tsx` (history API), `store.tsx` (loads
  `/api/listings` + `/api/state`, optimistic writes back), `icons.tsx`
  (hand-rolled), `app.css` (the whole design system), `screens/`, `components/`.
- `db/schema.sql` — sessions, login_attempts, deal_state, settings (JSON docs
  keyed `alerts`/`scoring`/`saved_searches`), listings, price_points.
- `scripts/` — build, cloudflare wrappers, fixtures preview, ingest pusher.

## Scoring

`scoreListing` in `src/shared/scoring.ts`: four weighted, independently
saturating components (price drop vs original, psf below benchmark, keyword
hits, staleness/relists), capped at 99. Tiers: hot ≥70, warm ≥45. Weights,
threshold, keywords, and staleness cutoff are user-tunable in Settings and
stored in D1; the worker's digest uses the same stored settings.

## The daily sweep (to activate after first deploy)

Create a scheduled Claude routine (fresh session, daily ~04:00 UTC = 08:00
UAE) with Firecrawl + Gmail connectors and this job:

1. Scrape Bayut/Property Finder/Dubizzle search pages for price-reduced /
   urgent-sale listings (Firecrawl structured extraction → the `Listing` shape
   in `src/shared/types.ts`; benchmarkPsf = community average of the batch
   when no DLD figure is available).
2. `POST <APP_URL>/api/ingest` with `Authorization: Bearer <INGEST_TOKEN>`.
3. `GET <APP_URL>/api/digest` — if `deals` is non-empty, email the digest to
   the configured recipient via Gmail and send a phone push with the count and
   top deal.

The routine needs three values: the live APP_URL (read from the deploy
output), the INGEST_TOKEN, and the digest recipient (set in app Settings).

## Gotchas already hit

- Pages binds secrets at deploy time — always redeploy after `cf:secrets`.
- Same-day price changes upsert into `price_points` (PK listing_id+date).
- `wrangler pages dev` reads `.dev.vars` (gitignored) for local secrets.
- The fixtures server (`npm run preview`) is the fastest way to see the UI —
  signed-in, demo data, in-memory state.
- Playwright + Chromium are preinstalled in Claude remote sessions
  (`NODE_PATH=/opt/node22/lib/node_modules`); PNG icons were rendered from
  `public/icons/icon.svg` that way.
